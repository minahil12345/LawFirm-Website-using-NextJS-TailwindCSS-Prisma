# =================== ðŸ“§ EMAIL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (Nodemailer + Gmail) ===================

# To enable sending emails from your website using Gmail, follow these simple steps:

# 1. Sign in to the Gmail account you want to use for sending emails.
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification on that Gmail account (required to generate App Password).
#    ðŸ‘‰ Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security â†’ Turn ON "2-Step Verification".

# 3. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, generate an "App Password" for your application:
#    ðŸ‘‰ Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/
#    - Search in tab about "App Password"
#    - Select App: "Mail"
#         otherwise
#    - Select Device: "Other" â†’ Enter "nodemailer" â†’ Click "Generate"
#    - Youâ€™ll get a 16-character password like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop

# 4. Copy the generated App Password (not your Gmail password).
#    Use this password along with your Gmail address in the fields below.

# 5. Replace these credentials with your own in the .env.local file:

#MAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
#MAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password

# Example:
# MAIL_USER=example@gmail.com
# MAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
