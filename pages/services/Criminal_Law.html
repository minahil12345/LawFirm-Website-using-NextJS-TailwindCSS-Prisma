  <h2>Landmark Criminal Defense Victories</h2>

  <div class="case-example">
    <img src="images/homicide-defense.jpg" alt="Homicide Trial Victory" class="case-image" />
    <div class="case-text">
      <h2>Case Study 1: Not Guilty Verdict in High-Profile Homicide Trial</h2>
      <p>
        Our client was charged with second-degree murder in a nationally publicized case. The prosecution had eyewitnesses and forensic evidence. After a detailed independent investigation and aggressive cross-examinations, our team exposed critical flaws in the timeline and reliability of the state's witnesses. The jury returned a <strong>Not Guilty</strong> verdict on all counts. Our client walked free, and their life was restored.

  <div class="case-text">
    <h2>Case Study 2: Acquittal in Major Cybercrime Prosecution</h2>
    <p>
      Our client, a university IT specialist, was charged with multiple federal offenses related to unauthorized access, identity theft, and distribution of sensitive data — allegedly compromising over 10,000 personal records. The FBI seized all digital equipment and the media called it “one of the most offensive breaches in years.”<br><br>
      We conducted a full digital forensic review and uncovered manipulation of server logs and improper chain of custody in evidence handling. Through expert testimony and meticulous cross-examination, we dismantled the prosecution's technical arguments. After a 10-day trial, our client was fully <strong>acquitted on all charges</strong> and returned to professional life with their reputation intact.

      <h2>Case Study 3: Major Drug Charges Dropped After Motion</h2>
      <p>
        Facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years for alleged drug trafficking, our client was stopped in what seemed like a routine traffic search. We challenged the legality of the stop and search, citing constitutional violations. The court agreed with our arguments and granted the motion to suppress. The charges were dropped completely, and our client avoided a lengthy prison term.
