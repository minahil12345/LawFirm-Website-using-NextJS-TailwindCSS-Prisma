# Project Installation Details
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Project Started
### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/law-firm-project.git
cd law-firm-project
```
### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file:
```bash
# Prisma Database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
```
Create a .env.local file:
```bash
# Mail credentials for Gmail (Create an App Password - See Notes Below)
MAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```
Details to do so are mentioned in .env or .env.local file in the main directory

### 3. Setup Database
Install Prisma CLI (if not already)
```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```
Update prisma/schema.prisma with your models (I have done already for my project so no need)
Push schema to database (I have done already for my project so no need)
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```
Migrate Database of PostGreSQL in your setup Folder. This will make generated folder in src folder.
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Run on DevelopmentIDE
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying from `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
